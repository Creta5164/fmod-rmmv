## Background

This plugin was created for the [2022 1Chicken game jam contest][1map],
a game jam event hosted by [1Map1Chicken RPG Maker contest][1map-twitter] in Korea.

The game we made by participating in this game jam was DOWNFALLEN,
and it was the opportunity to create the corresponding plug-in for this game.

[The entry page can be viewed here][DOWNFALLEN], but this game is in Korean.

## Table of content


# [1.](#table-of-content) Basic knowledge requirements

- Knows how to use FMOD Studio.

- Well aware of the [license][fmod-license], [attribution][fmod-attribution]
  and [legal information][fmod-legal] of FMOD.

# [2.](#table-of-content) Limitation

This plug-in was made in a short period of almost a week,
so some RPG Maker features that were not contained from DOWNFALLEN,
the game that used this plug-in or some features of FMOD, are missed for now.  
That's the reason I released this plugin as alpha stage.

Pull request or contribution are always welcome!

Currently, the limitations I have identified are as follows.

- System-specific audio settings not implemented yet  
  There is not yet a features that allows you to specifying system-specified audio,
  like from music such as title, game-over, etc.
  to sound effects such as cursor move, choice, cancel, save, load, etc.

- Velocity for doppler effect, etc.  
  The characters in RPG Maker have very consistent movement speeds,
  so when I applied velocity to them, the results were very strange
  so I didn't implement it.

- Streaming RPG Maker's native audio system to FMOD  
  FMOD has a feature that helps to read an external audio buffer
  and output it through the bus, but this has not been
  implemented yet.

- Not fully implemented ME specs  
  I have not yet implemented the specification of ME that plays
  BGM when it is interrupted during BGM playback and ME plays
  and disappears.

- Can't support event callbacks  
  Event callback is a feature that receives this signal from the game
  when a call function is put in an event created in FMOD Studio.  
  It also provides basic functions such as beat per callbacks, etc.  
  
  Anyways, this is a big mistake in my plugin design.
  
  Callbacks can be registered for events in the FMOD, but cannot be unregistered.  
  This is presumably because the FMOD assumes that the event is
  instantiated and used once and then discarded.
  
  FMOD also provides its own object pooling system.
  
  However, I implemented the pooling of the instanced event without knowing this,
  and the above problems resulted in an environment where callbacks could not be used naturally.
  
  Currently, this mistake is the biggest technical debt for this plugin.

- All of the battle related features  
  Since we didn't have to use it while making DOWNFALLEN.

# [3.](#table-of-content) Setup project

First, put `FMOD_MV.js` in the `plugins` folder, and then add the plugin in the project.

Plugin's order doesn't matter, unless you're using additional audio-related featured plugins.

# [4.](#table-of-content) Plugin options

## [4.1.](#table-of-content) Total memory

FMOD's virtual memories' maximum size. (byte units)  
Default setting is `64MB`. (`64 * 1024 * 1024`)

## [4.2.](#table-of-content) Bank asset path

Specify the path where the FMOD's Bank assets are.  
Default setting is `audio/bank`.

![bank-files](./img/bank-files.png)  
Bank files created by building in FMOD Studio must all be in the this path.

## [4.3.](#table-of-content) Bank assets

Specify banks to load.  
Master bank and it's strings must be assigned.  
i.e. if you have `Master Bank.bank`, `Master Bank.strings.bank`, `Music.bank` then
you should add `Master Bank`, `Master Bank.strings`, `Music` at this option.

## [4.4.](#table-of-content) GUIDs js path

Specify GUID collection script file.  
Default setting is `audio/bank/fmod_studio_guids.js`

This script file(`fmod_studio_guids.js`) can be created by the following below process.

1. **Overwrite `exportGUIDsHeader.js` in this repository to your FMOD Studio's scripts file**  
   ![overwrite-export-guids-header](./img/overwrite-export-guids-header.png)  
   There is a folder called `scripts` in the folder where FMOD Studio is installed, overwrite the script file in it.

2. **Export GUIDs header in FMOD Studio's menu : `Scripts/FMOD Examples/Export GUIDs Header/js File`.**  
   ![export-guids-header-as-js](./img/export-guids-header-as-js.png)  
   Then FMOD Studio will generate GUID header scripts and save as `fmod_studio_guids.js` in the same location as the project file you are currently working on.  
   ![exported-guids](./img/exported-guids.png)  
   > Note : If there is an unintentional duplicate of the event name in generated script(`fmod_studio_guids.js`) file, this script will not work due to an error.  
   This possibly can resolved by restarting FMOD Studio, and creating the GUID header script again.

3. **Move the generated script to the path in plugin option.**  
   ![move-generated-script-to-specified-path](./img/move-generated-script-to-specified-path.png)

That's it!  

## [4.5.](#table-of-content) Integrated VCAs

Specify which VCA is used for each types of channels.  
If you leave these blank, FMOD_MV.js will try finds a VCA name
with `BGM`, `BGS`, `ME`, `SE`, if found them then
it will be used automatically.
