## Background

This plugin was created for the [2022 1Chicken game jam contest][1map],
a game jam event hosted by [1Map1Chicken RPG Maker contest][1map-twitter] in Korea.

The game we made by participating in this game jam was DOWNFALLEN,
and it was the opportunity to create the corresponding plug-in for this game.

[The entry page can be viewed here][DOWNFALLEN], but this game is in Korean.
